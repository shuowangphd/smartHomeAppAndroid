# Smart Home Gesture Control Application

The Smart Home Gesture Control Application is a project aimed at enhancing the convenience and interactivity of smart homes by enabling users to control their devices using hand gestures. The project consists of two main parts: an Android application and a Python application for gesture classification.

## Part 1: Android Application
The Android application serves as the user interface for controlling smart home devices. It allows users to perform specific hand gestures in front of their device's camera to trigger actions such as turning lights on or off, adjusting the temperature, controlling multimedia devices, and more. The application utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize and interpret the gestures performed by the user, translating them into corresponding commands for the smart home devices.

## Part 2: Machine Learning for Gesture Classification
The Python application focuses on the machine learning aspect of the project. It involves training and testing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to accurately classify hand gestures associated with various smart home commands. The training process involves collecting a dataset of labeled hand gesture images and training the CNN model to learn the patterns and features that distinguish different gestures. The trained model is then integrated into the Android application, enabling real-time gesture recognition and command execution.
